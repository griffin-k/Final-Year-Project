## Introduction

The Luna robot project focuses on building and programming a humanoid robot capable of performing various tasks. The project involves 3D printing the robot parts, assembling the hardware, and writing the software to control the robot.

## Features

- **3D Printed Parts:** All parts of the robot are designed to be 3D printed.
- **Modular Design:** The robot's design is modular, allowing easy customization and upgrades.
- **Open-Source Software:** The control software for the robot is open-source, enabling collaboration and improvements from the community.
- **Articulated Movements:** The robot can perform a wide range of articulated movements.
- **Speech Recognition and Synthesis:** The robot can understand spoken commands and respond verbally.
